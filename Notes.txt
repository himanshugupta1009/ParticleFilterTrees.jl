1) It all starts with main.jl
      That is where the action_info function is defined.
      The action_info function calls the _search function to build the tree iteratively.

2) The _search function essentially uses one of the two functions in search.jl (depending on the solver parameter) to build the tree.
      Either obs_check_search or no_obs_check_search

3) Now, both obs_check_search and no_obs_check_search internally call the GenBelief function.
      This function is where bp, o and r are generated and returned.

4) This GenBelief function is what needs to be modified to solve a rho-POMDP.
            The for loop from line 45 to 65 needs to be such that it is belief dependent and not reward dependent.
